                    <h3>Assessment of Agile Maturity</h3>
                    Agile assessments are crucial to understand where you stand and what areas to improve.
                       <br><br>We want our teams to be agile and continue to deliver great results.
                       However, its easier said than done. Many teams who start with agile do well in their initial journey
                       of agile adoption but after a while they plateau and dont have enough knowledge on how to improve further.

                       <br><br>What teams need is guided coaching around where their bottlenecks are and how they can minize those over
                       a period of time. And all this starts with assessing how they are placed on Agile maturity.
                       <br><br>The key is to understand the foundational issues faced by teams in Agile and provide remedies that are sustainable and effective.
                       Such assessment needs to be done both at Organization level as well as Teams to identify the cultural and technological gaps that exists within groups.<br><br><br>

                    <h3>What is our Assessment Method</h3>
                     <strong>1) Conduct a discovery exercise to know AS-IS state of Agile adoption</strong><br>
                      Discovery exercise could be from few days to a couple of weeks depending on size of team/program/organization.<br><br>

                      <strong>2) Interview Leadership and Teams to understand challenges & cultural aspects</strong> <br>
                      Going by Agile manifesto - individuals and interactions over processes and tools, this one to one interaction with teams and leadership helps to understand
                      the cultural challenges that exist and how we can holitically approach towards improving the mindset of agile across the board.<br><br>

                      <strong>3) Assess teams maturity </strong><br>
                      Assessment is done on various factors such as Agile practices, Product Ownership, Collaboration, Technical Expertise with 20+ parameters in each area<br><br>

                      <strong>4) Provide a comprehensive report</strong> <br>
                      The comprehensive report entails details of discovery done, interviews conducted, teams met and the overall assessment done with score.<br>
                      This report helps our consultants to engage with leadership for charting future strategy within the current constraints of the organization.
                      We firmly believe that one size fits all doesnt work and a purist approach towards Agile is often aspirational than realistic. The report will help us in having
                      a meaningful discussion for coming up with a roadmap and strategy.<br><br>

                      <strong>5) Actively engage with Leadership to Define a future roadmap and strategy </strong><br>
                      We believe an Improvement roadmap helps in determining the steps required to acheive the next level and timeframes within which to acheive them.<br>
                      This helps team and leadership to stay focused and agile maturity lifecycle itself becomes a value driven initiative.<br>
                      Such a roadmap will also include role based and certification based training required by the various roles and may also include technical practices such as DevOps and Cloud Tech to improve overall agility.<br><br>

                      <strong>6) Identify Pilot and execute the roadmap </strong><br>
                      There are significant benefits to start small, measure acheivements and anchor the changes into culture through expansion.<br>
                      Identifying the right pilot team is crucial as we need teams of motivated individuals who are ready to embrace the new ways of working in Agile. <br><br><br>
