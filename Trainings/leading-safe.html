                                <h3>Why SAFe is important today?</h3>
                                Recent years have seen Agile practices flow out of IT and into various business departments, leading to Agile Engineering, Agile Human Resources and Agile Marketing organizations, among others. This expansion is likely to continue at an even faster pace in 2020.<br><br>
                                Enterprise Agile is reshaping the way enterprises do businessand Agile is the best way anyone has found to create products that serve customers and drive business value. The principles of constant feedback and rapid iteration are just as valid at the enterprise scale as they are for smaller organizations.<br><br>
                                SAFe is rightly placed to provide enterprises with a defined framework and measuring business agility which has been proven over many years of evolution. <br><br>
                                SAFe 5.0's focus on business agility brings the much needed aligment between business and technology leaders and provides an oppurtinity to business and management leaders to apply lean and Agile practices to remains competitive and innovative. <br>
