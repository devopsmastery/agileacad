                        <h3>SAFe Scrum Master Trainings</h3>
                        SAFe (Scaled Agile Framework for Enterprises) is one of the leading frameworks used in Scaling Agile projects/programs.<br><br>

                        Build your skills as a high-performing team member of an Agile Release Train (ART)—and prepare to support the facilitation of team and program events—when you become a SAFe® 5 Scrum Master (SSM). <br>
